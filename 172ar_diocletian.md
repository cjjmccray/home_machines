### 04-Nov-2017
Added get_iplayer. Had to [install this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~jon-hedgerows/+archive/ubuntu/get-iplayer):
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jon-hedgerows/get-iplayer
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install get-iplayer
```

### 20-Oct-2017
Upgraded to Ubuntu 17.10.

Also installed [two benchmarking/system listing tools](https://askubuntu.com/questions/198978/is-there-a-benchmark-tool-for-ubuntu):
* hardinfo (runs in the GUI) - sudo apt-get install hardinfo
* Phoronix Test Suite (terminal only) - sudo apt-get install phoronix-test-suite
** uninstalled afterwards - it's old and difficult to use

### Apr-2017
Upgraded to Ubuntu 17.04

### 10-Dec-2016
HipChat 4 installed and used to login to my MetaPack HipChat account.

Still getting two weak digest algorithm errors:

but seems to have cleared the problem.

### 09-May-2016 - Temperature sensors

First install some stuff: 

    sudo apt-get sensors-applet
    sudo apt install lm-sensors
    sudo apt-get install hddtemp

Then:

    sudo service kmod start

Finally at a terminal run `sensors`

    chrism@diocletian:~$ sensors
    acpitz-virtual-0
    Adapter: Virtual device
    temp1:        +46.0°C  (crit = +98.0°C)
    
    thinkpad-isa-0000
    Adapter: ISA adapter
    fan1:        3240 RPM
    
    coretemp-isa-0000
    Adapter: ISA adapter
    Physical id 0:  +47.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
    Core 0:         +45.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
    Core 1:         +46.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
    
    chrism@diocletian:~$ 

But to monitor everything:

    sudo sensors-detect

    chrism@diocletian:~$ sudo sensors-detect
    # sensors-detect revision 6284 (2015-05-31 14:00:33 +0200)
    # System: LENOVO 4236D42 [ThinkPad T420] (laptop)
    # Kernel: 4.4.0-22-generic x86_64

    This program will help you determine which kernel modules you need
    to load to use lm_sensors most effectively. It is generally safe
    and recommended to accept the default answers to all questions,
    unless you know what you're doing.
    
    Some south bridges, CPUs or memory controllers contain embedded sensors.
    Do you want to scan for them? This is totally safe. (YES/no): YES

    AMD Family 16h power sensors...                             No

    VIA Nano thermal sensor...                                  No
    
    Some Super I/O chips contain embedded sensors. We have to write to
    standard I/O ports to probe them. This is usually safe.
    Do you want to scan for Super I/O sensors? (YES/no): YES
    Probing for Super-I/O at 0x2e/0x2f
    Trying family `National Semiconductor/ITE'...               No
    Trying family `SMSC'...                                     No

    Trying family `ITE'...                                      No
    
    Some hardware monitoring chips are accessible through the ISA I/O ports.
    We have to write to arbitrary I/O ports to probe them. This is usually
    safe though. Yes, you do have ISA I/O ports even if you do not have any
    ISA slots! Do you want to scan the ISA I/O ports? (YES/no): YES
    Probing for `National Semiconductor LM78' at 0x290...       No
    Probing for `National Semiconductor LM79' at 0x290...       No
    Probing for `Winbond W83781D' at 0x290...                   No
    Probing for `Winbond W83782D' at 0x290...                   No
    
    Lastly, we can probe the I2C/SMBus adapters for connected hardware
    monitoring devices. This is the most risky part, and while it works
    reasonably well on most systems, it has been reported to cause trouble
    on some systems.
    Do you want to probe the I2C/SMBus adapters now? (YES/no): YES

    Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
    Just press ENTER to continue: 
    
    Driver `coretemp':
      * Chip `Intel digital thermal sensor' (confidence: 9)
    
    To load everything that is needed, add this to /etc/modules:
    #----cut here----
    # Chip drivers
    coretemp
    #----cut here----
    If you have some drivers built into your kernel, the list above will
    contain too many modules. Skip the appropriate ones!
    
    Do you want to add these lines automatically to /etc/modules? (yes/NO)yes
    Successful!
    
    Monitoring programs won't work until the needed modules are
    loaded. You may want to run '/etc/init.d/kmod start'
    to load them.
    
    Unloading i2c-i801... OK
    
    chrism@diocletian:~$ 

And get it runing using:

    sudo /etc/init.d/kmod start

Last one, install psensor

    sudo apt-get install psensor

And run it as `psensor` and watch some graphs.  CPU temp around 50 degrees C.  Which is fine.  Compared to Severus in the Living room that keeps restarting as it's CPU temp hits it's auto-off point of 100 degrees C.


### Apr-2016
Ubuntu 15.04 (April/May 2015) upgraded to 15.10 (October 2015) and 16.04 (April 2016).

If prompted to run 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove old stuff, that's done as a matter of course and won't be logged.


## Slackware 14.1 (64-bit)
Kernel 3.10.17.


## Windows 7
Is installed, but it blue-screens briefly while booting then reboots immediately.  i.e. is unusable.  Recovery boot prompts for Windows 7 CD/DVD which I don't have, though could probably get from the Microsoft website easily enough.  Although the bottom of the laptop has no Windows COA licence sticker, so that might come completely unstuck.
