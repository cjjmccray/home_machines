# New Kitchen PC

## Tue 27-Mar-2018
### DVD+RW drive
Still not recognised.  Will revert to the DVD-ROM drive that came with the machine.

### EasyWeather
- Found the software on [this page here](https://www.ambientweather.com/software.html)
- Scroll and you can see the EasyWeather software (you don't have to pay any money)
- Installed OK and it immediately finds the weather system (yay!)

### AVerMedia TV Card
AVerTV Hybrid Volar T2 - H831
- Search for the code "H831" on the AVerMedia website
- [Driver (32-bit)](http://www.avermedia.com/tv_more/download/avertv_hybrid_volar_t2#ans_part)
- Scanned and found all previous TV channels (YAY!) - though I still suspect there's only software issues with the cheaper DVB-T UTL-2832 chip-based sticks I got from China.

### Womble MPEG Video Wizard DVD 5.0
- I have a licence for this, and can use it on multiple machines that I use
- Not sure where the licence codes are though!
- Found full licence I bought in 2009 (and reprinted from e-mail in 2012) - yay!
- [Download (32-bit)](http://www.womble.com/download/)
- [Manual](http://www.womble.com/docs/dvd-guide.pdf)

### Notepad ++ and Geany
- [Notepad++ (64-bit)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [Geany (32-bit)](https://www.geany.org/)

## Previously...
### Avast & 7-Zip
Avast anti-virus installed.  7-Zip 64-bit as well.

### Adobe PDF Reader and PDF Creator
Installed both.

### TV and Video software
MP2 and SichboPVR both installed and uninstalled (didn't work with the Chinese DVB-T USB sticks).

### Libre Office and Java Runtime
- Java Runtime 8u162 64-bit to get the database to work
- Libre Office 6.0.1 64-bit

# Old Kitchen PC.  Migrating to new machine, 27-Mar-2018.
## Software to migrate
- PSP6: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Graphics\PSP6 (from Kitchen PC)\C-ProgFiles
  - Might be better to install PSP8 from DVD (you have 3x licences and only 1x in use)
- EasyWeather: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Miscellany\Easyweather\C-ProgFiles
  - I should have the original install CD somewhere
- MPEG Video Wizard DVD 5.0: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Miscellany\MPEG Video Wizard DVD\C-ProgFiles
  - the licence document is upstairs somewhere
  - I suspect there are hidden files and/or registry keys that this requires (I seem to recall the copy/reload method doesn't work)
- Java runtime, Libre Office, Adobe PDF Reader, GiMP, VLC, MP3DirectCut (v2.13 is installed, and I can't figure out how to use the later versions!), Audacity, ImgBurn, uTorrent, Geany, Notepad++
  - Deprecated/not needed: FileZilla, UltraVNC Server and Viewer, Zinf, freac (free audio convertor?)
