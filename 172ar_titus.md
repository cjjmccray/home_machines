Old Kitchen PC.  Migrating to new machine, 27-Mar-2018.

## Software
- PSP6: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Graphics\PSP6 (from Kitchen PC)\C-ProgFiles
  - Might be better to install PSP8 from DVD (you have 3x licences and only 1x in use)
- EasyWeather: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Miscellany\Easyweather\C-ProgFiles
  - I should have the original install CD somewhere
- MPEG Video Wizard DVD 5.0: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Miscellany\MPEG Video Wizard DVD\C-ProgFiles
  - the licence document is upstairs somewhere
  - I suspect there are hidden files and/or registry keys that this requires (I seem to recall the copy/reload method doesn't work)
- Java runtime, Libre Office, Adobe PDF Reader, GiMP, VLC, MP3DirectCut (v2.13 is installed, and I can't figure out how to use the later versions!), Audacity, ImgBurn, uTorrent, Geany, Notepad++
  - Deprecated/not needed: FileZilla, UltraVNC Server and Viewer, Zinf, freac (free audio convertor?)
