# New Kitchen PC
## AVerMedia TV Card
AVerTV Hybrid Volar T2 - H831
- Search for the code "H831" on the AVerMedia website
- [Driver](http://www.avermedia.com/tv_more/download/avertv_hybrid_volar_t2#ans_part)
- Scanned and found all previous TV channels (YAY!) - though I still suspect there's only software issues with the cheaper DVB-T sticks I got from China

## Womble MPEG Video Wizard DVD 5.0
- I have a licence for this, and can use it on multiple machines that I use
- Not sure where the licence codes are though!
- Using a 30-day free trial code for now (27-Mar-2018, so expires on 25-Apr-2018)

# Old Kitchen PC.  Migrating to new machine, 27-Mar-2018.
## Software to migrate
- PSP6: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Graphics\PSP6 (from Kitchen PC)\C-ProgFiles
  - Might be better to install PSP8 from DVD (you have 3x licences and only 1x in use)
- EasyWeather: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Miscellany\Easyweather\C-ProgFiles
  - I should have the original install CD somewhere
- MPEG Video Wizard DVD 5.0: copied to: \\Geta\software and os images\Miscellany\MPEG Video Wizard DVD\C-ProgFiles
  - the licence document is upstairs somewhere
  - I suspect there are hidden files and/or registry keys that this requires (I seem to recall the copy/reload method doesn't work)
- Java runtime, Libre Office, Adobe PDF Reader, GiMP, VLC, MP3DirectCut (v2.13 is installed, and I can't figure out how to use the later versions!), Audacity, ImgBurn, uTorrent, Geany, Notepad++
  - Deprecated/not needed: FileZilla, UltraVNC Server and Viewer, Zinf, freac (free audio convertor?)
