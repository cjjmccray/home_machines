# RasPi B v3, Raspbian, FlightRader24.com node

[This is the Google Docs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13g7ZNwzXMAQLAqDtCsuYq0GRw1QThN0PuuL1DDB-NSY/edit#gid=512237026) used to track stats etc...

## 31-Dec-2018
FR node been uncommunicative for months. IT IS WORKING... but the key with the FR24 website has expired.
- House Lat/Long - see the spreadsheet
- Height above sea level - see the spreadsheet

Then followed my nose and the instructions about restarting the software - still doesn't connect.

The FR24 node web interface offers to check the settings, edit them and restart...

- http://192.168.1.41:8754/tracked.html

But still no planes being detected as the config seems to default to the wrong type of detector.

Actually carried out between Christmas 2016 and New Year 2017, shortened the antenna to 67mm and mounted (glued) onto an old coffee tub, [using these instructions](http://forum.flightradar24.com/threads/9711-Optimize-the-Whip-Antenna-Which-Is-Supplied-With-DVB-T-Dongle).

Name chosen: [galerius](http://www.roman-emperors.org/galerius.htm)

IP address selected: 192.168.1.41
Gateway: 192.168.0.2
Netmask: 255.255.254.0

Issue following the usual instructions, when you come to start dropbear to do ssh, it fails silently.

Checking /var/log/dropbear.log and there's a complaint about the motd file not right - it's looking for /etc/motd.net.  /etc/motd exists so a symlink has been created from /etc/motd.net to /etc/motd

Slackware 14.1 regular setup ensued.

Swap file: 1G, Linux partition: 13.9G.

### Flightradar24
The default instaler is designed for Rasbian and instructions rely on being able to use Ubuntu-like apt-get etc...  There's a deb file which when converted using deb2tgz installed but doesn't run (complains of file not found).  Suspect there are dependencies not installed...

#### rtl-sdr
Cloned from git into /root/git

git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git

Instructions here: http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

    cd rtl-sdr/
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

#### dump1090
Cloned from git into /root/git

git  clone  git://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090.git

Instructions here: http://forum.flightradar24.com/threads/8591-Raspberry-Pi-How-To-Install-Raspian-OS-Dump1090-FR24-Data-Feeder

    make
    ./dump1090 --interactive --net --net-http-port 8080
 
 and I did get the error message:
 
    root@galerius:~/git/dump1090# ./dump1090 --interactive --net --net-http-port 8080
     Found 1 device(s):

    Kernel driver is active, or device is claimed by second instance of librtlsdr.
    In the first case, please either detach or blacklist the kernel module
    (dvb_usb_rtl28xxu), or enable automatic detaching at compile time.
    
    usb_claim_interface error -6
    Error opening the RTLSDR device: Device or resource busy

OK, dump1090 *works*:

and earlier I was getting 3-5 planes overhead, but... the fr24feed program just refuses to start.

F**k it, switch to Raspbian...

## Raspbian
Out of the box there's one user created, 'pi' with password 'raspberry'/

First thing - get it to work over wifi with a static IP address:
http://www.modmypi.com/blog/how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address-update

192.168.1.41 set as the wifi static address
DNS - changed the default DNS server from the last wifi box found to 192.168.0.2 and added to /etc/resolv.conf 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 (both from OpenDNS).

## 06-Jun-2016 1725h
Installed dnsutils to allow dig and nslookup to work, also was suggested to install rblcheck so did so (not sure what it does).
Installed geeknote and my geeknote_update.sh.

Hmmm... from a terminal as user 'pi' geeknote login done but though gnsync looks to be running OK, there's nothing in my Evernote.  Copied to /etc/cron.daily and also sudo'd to geeknote login.  We'll see.

Machine downed @ 1730h having been up 1day 11h43m to move.


todo
* set a different password for the "pi" user!
* set the machine name to 'galerius' (it's currently 'raspberrypi')
* get static ip to work on wifi *or* put a network wire into the attic
