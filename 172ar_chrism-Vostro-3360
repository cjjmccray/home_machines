Machine Name
============
Defaulted to what Ubuntu chose on install: chrism-Vostro-3360

Hardware
========
Dell Vostro 3360 booting through a USB stick to Ubuntu 17.04 x64

Configuration Changes
=====================
Standard install of Ubuntu 17.04 64-bit from one USB stick to another.  Despite being instructed not to do so, it *has* installed a grub boot loader on the main HDD.

Real-Time Clock (RTC
--------------------
Changed Ubuntu so it treats the hardware RTC as being in local time on UTC, so hopefully when booting back to Windows the time isn't wrong and causing issues.  Details [in this page](https://askubuntu.com/questions/169376/clock-time-is-off-on-dual-boot), but in essence you just run:
```timedatectl set-local-rtc 1```
at the command prompt.
